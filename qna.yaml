          Useful life of the mover and saftey
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the Average Useful Life of the mower according to the CPSC and EPA?
        answer: |
          According to the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
          this product has an Average Useful Life of seven (7) years or 140 hours of operation.
      - question: |
          What should you do at the end of the mower's Average Useful Life?
        answer: |
          At the end of the Average Useful Life, have the mower inspected annually by an authorized service dealer to
          ensure that all mechanical and safety systems are working properly and not worn excessively.
      - question: |
          What is the function of the engine's governor?
        answer: |
          The governor controls the maximum safe operating speed of the engine. Do not change the engine's governor
          setting or over-speed the engine, as this can cause the engine to operate at unsafe speeds.
      - question: |
          What safety device must never be bypassed?

          Cleaning and inspection
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What should you do before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting the mower?
        answer: |
          Make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground it against
          the engine to prevent unintended starting.
      - question: |
          What should you do if you strike a foreign object while operating the mower?
        answer: |
          If you strike a foreign object while operating the mower, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and
          ground it against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage and repair the damage before starting
          and operating the mower.
      - question: |
          What precautions should you take when mowing on slopes?
        answer: |
          Mow across the face of slopes, never up and down. Exercise extreme caution when changing direction on slopes.
          Avoid mowing excessively steep slopes. Use caution when operating the mower near drop-offs, ditches, or
          embankments.
      - question: |
          How should you store gasoline?
        answer: |
          Store gasoline in a cool, well-ventilated area, safely away from the house. Never store gasoline or the machine
          with gasoline in the tank inside a building where fumes may reach an open flame, spark, or pilot light as on a
          furnace, water heater, or clothes dryer.
      - question: |
          How should you prepare the mower for storage?
        answer: |
          Allow the engine to cool before storing in any enclosure. Clean the mower thoroughly, including the grass catcher,
          to remove all grass clippings, dirt, and debris. Wipe the mower clean to prevent any buildup of flammable
          materials.
      - question: |
          What should you do if the engine fails to start?
        answer: |
          If the engine fails to start, check the fuel level, ensure the spark plug wire is connected, and make sure the
          engine controls are set correctly. Follow the starting procedure as outlined in the manual. If the engine still
          fails to start, refer to the troubleshooting section of the manual.
      - question: |
          How should you maintain the mower's air filter?
        answer: |
          Clean the air filter regularly according to the instructions in the manual. A clogged air filter can reduce
          engine performance and increase fuel consumption. Replace the air filter if it is damaged or excessively
          dirty.
      - question: |
          What type of oil should be used in the mower's engine?
        answer: |
          Use only high-quality detergent oil rated with an API service classification of SF, SG, SH, or SJ. Select the
          appropriate oil viscosity for the expected outdoor temperature range as specified in the manual.
      - question: |
          How should you change the engine oil?
        answer: |
          Run the engine for a few minutes to warm the oil. Stop the engine and disconnect the spark plug wire. Drain the
          oil by removing the oil drain plug. Reinstall the drain plug and refill the engine with the recommended oil
          type and quantity. Check the oil level and ensure it is at the correct level.
      - question: |
          How often should you sharpen the mower blade?
        answer: |
          Sharpen the mower blade at least once a season to ensure a clean cut. If the blade becomes dull, bent, or
          damaged, sharpen or replace it immediately. Always balance the blade after sharpening to prevent excessive
          vibration and wear on the mower.
      - question: |
          What should you do before each use of the mower?
        answer: |
          Before each use, check the mower's safety devices, engine oil level, and fuel level. Inspect the blade and the
          area around the blade for any obstructions or damage. Ensure all nuts, bolts, and screws are tight to ensure the
          mower is in safe operating condition.
      - question: |
          What maintenance should you perform on the drive system?
        answer: |
          Regularly check and adjust the drive system according to the instructions in the manual. Lubricate the drive
          system components as specified to ensure smooth operation and prevent excessive wear. Replace worn or damaged
          parts promptly to maintain optimal performance.
